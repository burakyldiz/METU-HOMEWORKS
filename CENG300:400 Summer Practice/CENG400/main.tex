\chapter{Introduction}
This report summarizes the summer practice I completed at ODTÜ-DTX (Dijital Dönüşüm ve İnovasyon Merkezi) between 01.09.2025 and 26.09.2025, under the supervision of Doç. Dr. Şeyda Ertekin.  
The practice was focused on improving my graduation project, a \textbf{Real-Time Location System (RTLS)} using BLE signals, ESP32 devices, and machine learning.  

The main objective was to advance the accuracy and robustness of indoor positioning systems by combining embedded hardware, cloud data pipelines, and advanced ML models.  
During this practice, I:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Programmed ESP32 boards to collect BLE RSSI data via ESP-NOW and uploaded readings to Firebase.
    \item Applied trilateration with path-loss models and compared its performance against ML-based approaches.
    \item Trained multiple ML models (kNN, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Ensembles) on collected datasets.
    \item Performed feature engineering (differences, ratios, statistics) and applied Kalman filtering for noise reduction.
    \item Developed a frontend page for visualizing real-time ML-based predictions in the project’s web application.
    \item Delivered periodic reports, research summaries, and evaluations to my academic supervisor.
\end{itemize}

The following chapters explain the project phases, organizational environment, and my personal reflections.

% ---------------------------
\chapter{Information about the Project}

\section{Analysis Phase}
The project started with identifying the main challenges of indoor RTLS:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Noisy RSSI signals:} BLE RSSI suffers from multipath fading and environmental interference.
    \item \textbf{Accuracy requirement:} Achieving sub-1 meter accuracy is difficult using RSSI alone.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The system must support many tags and scanners in real-time.
\end{itemize}

We explored multiple approaches: classical trilateration with path-loss models, fingerprinting with ML classifiers, and data smoothing via filters (Kalman).  
A data collection plan was prepared for two testbeds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Testbed A:} A $3 \times 4$ grid in a controlled lab environment, 1m $\times$ 1m cells, 60 samples per cell (total 720 samples).
    \item \textbf{Testbed B:} A $9 \times 12$ grid in a factory environment, 0.5m $\times$ 0.5m cells, 30 samples per cell (total 3240 samples).
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\section{Design Phase}
The design phase focused on the end-to-end pipeline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hardware:} 3 ESP32 scanners placed at key anchor points, configured with ESP-NOW for low-latency data collection.
    \item \textbf{Database:} Firebase Realtime Database as the central storage layer for RSSI readings.
    \item \textbf{Algorithms:} Both trilateration and ML models designed to process RSSI data.
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} Integration of a dashboard into the existing React-based webapp to visualize predictions and errors in real time.
\end{itemize}

Architectural diagrams were created to ensure modularity: hardware (data collection), software (data processing), ML (training + inference), and UI (visualization).

\section{Implementation Phase}
The main implementation tasks were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ESP32 Programming:} Configured ESP32 WROOM-32 boards to scan BLE beacons, filter known MAC addresses, and transmit results via ESP-NOW.
    \item \textbf{Firebase Integration:} Implemented code to stream RSSI readings into structured JSON format.
    \item \textbf{ML Modeling:} Created pipelines for kNN, RF, SVM, and XGB, with feature engineering (ratios, differences, statistics, dist-like transforms).
    \item \textbf{Kalman Filtering:} Implemented an in-pipeline Kalman filter to reduce variance while preserving signal trends.
    \item \textbf{Frontend Extension:} Added an RTLS visualization panel to the web dashboard, showing real-time position predictions and error heatmaps.
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing Phase}
Testing included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing:} Verified ESP32 firmware modules (BLE scanning, ESP-NOW transmission).
    \item \textbf{Dataset Testing:} Split datasets into 80/20 train-test for fair evaluation.
    \item \textbf{Cross-validation:} Used 5-fold CV for hyperparameter tuning of ML models.
    \item \textbf{Performance Metrics:} Accuracy, mean grid error, mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE were tracked.
    \item \textbf{Visualization:} Confusion matrices and offset heatmaps used to diagnose spatial error distributions.
\end{itemize}

Results showed that ML-based fingerprinting with XGB and Random Forest achieved much higher accuracy than raw trilateration, especially when combined with feature engineering and Kalman filtering.

\chapter{Conclusion}
The summer practice at ODTÜ-DTX allowed me to deepen my expertise in embedded systems, IoT data pipelines, and ML for real-time localization.  
Key achievements include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Successfully built a complete RTLS pipeline: ESP32 scanners $\rightarrow$ Firebase $\rightarrow$ ML pipeline $\rightarrow$ frontend visualization.
    \item Demonstrated that ML fingerprinting outperforms trilateration in noisy indoor environments.
