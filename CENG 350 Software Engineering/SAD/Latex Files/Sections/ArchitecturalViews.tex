\subsubsection{Deployment Diagram Explanations}

The deployment diagram includes the following nodes and their connections:

\textbf{User Devices:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web Browser:} Connects to the Web Server to provide a web-based interface for users.
    \item \textbf{Mobile Device:} Connects to the Web Server to provide a mobile interface for users.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{FarmBot Local Network:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FarmBot Controller:} Connects to Sensors and Actuators within the local network to manage farming tasks. It also connects to the Application Server for data processing and receiving commands.
    \item \textbf{Sensors:} Provide environmental data to the FarmBot Controller.
    \item \textbf{Actuators:} Execute farming tasks based on commands from the FarmBot Controller.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cloud Services:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web Server:} Hosts the web application and connects to the Application Server.
    \item \textbf{Application Server:} Processes data and commands, connects to the Database Server for data storage, and connects to the Weather API for weather data.
    \item \textbf{Database Server:} Stores data collected and processed by the FarmBot system.
    \item \textbf{Weather API:} Provides weather data to the Application Server for informed decision-making.
\end{itemize}

The deployment diagram and explanations illustrate how the FarmBot system's components are deployed across different nodes, ensuring efficient and effective operation.

\section{Design Rationale}

\textbf{Design Rationale:} The deployment view ensures that system components are correctly distributed across different nodes, supporting efficient data processing, communication, and operational management. This view is critical for maintaining the reliability and performance of the FarmBot system.
